    <p> Protocols are our friends! A great deal of magic in Oatmeal is based around them, and the <code>Container</code> itself even adheres to the <code>Resolveable</code> protocol itself. So if you wanted to seperate your instances of <code>Container</code> by binding them to Oats(), you could very well do that. These protocols can be stacked together to do a number of things. </p>

      Events can be registered from any class. This protocol will register them whenever the class is resolved.

             <h2><a name="Singletons">Working With Singletons</a></h2>
             <p>
             Singletons are different from regular members by one key fact: they persist for the lifecycle of your application from the moment you stick them into the container. In fact, <a href="/pages/Events.html">Events</a> are a singleton. Classes of the same type can be stored in the container as a Singleton as long as they have a unique entityName or customEntityName if they are <code>Autoresolveable</code></p>

             <h4>When should I use a Singleton?</h4>
             <p>Most classes you utilize with Oatmeal do not need to be a singleton. In fact, if you just need to persist state you can use the Filecache to do so for later retrieval. Using the <code>
             get&lt;T:Resolveable&lt;()</code> method, you can return your object back in mostly the same state it was when you cached it. Serialization for common Types is supported. Events is a Singleton because it waits for recievers to act upon.</p>

             <h4>Adding a singleton to the container</h4>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
               <code>
                  //As discussed earlier this is pretty trivial.
                  let composer = UserComposer()
                  composer <~> ~Oats()
                  let myUser = User()
                  myUser.name = "mikenolimits"
                  composer.user.append(myUser)
                  //now our composer is in the container, we can utilize it from 
                  //anywhere in our app
